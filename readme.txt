# Object Avoiding Robot

The primary purpose of this bot is to traverse forward autonomously and change directions if it encounters any significant obstacle in its path. The bot will avoid any obstacle big enough to be detected by the ultrasonic sensors mounted on the front
an autonomous robot which intelligently detects obstacle path and navigate convenientlyÂ according to the actions we set for it
